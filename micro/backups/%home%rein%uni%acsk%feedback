A terribly unprofessional template that doesn't adhere to your own formatting instructions.

Extremely vague instructions including the "Unknown part" of the window, which we are instructed to fill in even though that's impossible in a Johari Window as is shown in the instruction video which was shamelessly stolen from youtube.

Not to mention having to sit in a lecture room for over two hours working on this horrid assignment.
